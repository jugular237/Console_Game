# Console_Game

### Consept idea:

There is a man in the middle of a console screen which shoots down monsters.
Monsters appear from three different directions : top, left and right. Game man must defend his home from creatures by 
choosing in which way to shoot. Luckily he has an infinite amount of bullets. Besides, his home has limited number of heatpoints,
so player should pay an att–µntion to not let mosters get to close and damage his house for too long.
Game ends by loosing anyway, so goals are to stay as long as you can and get as many kills as you can.

### Controls:

Left, rigth and top arrow, depending in what direction player want to shoot. 

### Aftergame results:

After each game player gets his statistics: survived time and killed monsters.
Try to play on these parameters, your best result will be written in records.

### For those who want to take a look in programm code or use it:

All scripts are located in 'Code' folder. There are basic classes such as 'BasicClass' or 'Constants' or interface 'IHitable'.
Main code is written in 'Game.cs' file. Initalizing player and monsters instances, their interaction. Whole logic of bullets is also here.
